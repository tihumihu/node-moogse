.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmongodump\fP is a utility for creating a binary export of the
contents of a database. Consider using this utility as part an
effective \fBbackup strategy\fP\&. Use
\fBmongodump\fP in conjunction with \fBmongorestore\fP to
restore databases.
.sp
\fBmongodump\fP can read data from either \fBmongod\fP or \fBmongos\fP
instances, in addition to reading directly from MongoDB data files
without an active \fBmongod\fP\&.
.sp

and http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/backups\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH BEHAVIOR
.sp
\fBmongodump\fP does \fInot\fP dump the content of the \fBlocal\fP database.
.sp
The data format used by \fBmongodump\fP from version 2.2 or
later is \fIincompatible\fP with earlier versions of \fBmongod\fP\&.
Do not use recent versions of \fBmongodump\fP to back up older
data stores.
.sp
When running \fBmongodump\fP against a \fBmongos\fP instance
where the \fIsharded cluster\fP consists of \fIreplica sets\fP, the \fIread preference\fP of the operation will prefer reads
from \fIsecondary\fP members of the set.
.sp
Changed in version 2.2: When used in combination with \fBfsync\fP or
\fBdb.fsyncLock()\fP, \fBmongod\fP may block some
reads, including those from \fBmongodump\fP, when
queued write operation waits behind the \fBfsync\fP
lock.

.SH REQUIRED ACCESS
.SS Backup Collections
.sp
To backup all the databases in a cluster via \fBmongodump\fP, you
should have the \fBbackup\fP role. The \fBbackup\fP role provides
all the needed privileges for backing up all database. The role confers no
additional access, in keeping with the policy of \fIleast privilege\fP\&.
.sp
To backup a given database, you must have \fBread\fP access on the database.
Several roles provide this access, including the \fBbackup\fP role.
.sp
To backup the \fBsystem.profile\fP collection in a database, you must have
\fBread\fP access on certain system collections in the database. Several roles
provide this access, including the \fBclusterAdmin\fP and
\fBdbAdmin\fP roles.
.SS Backup Users
.sp
Changed in version 2.6.

.sp
To backup users and \fIuser\-defined roles\fP for a
given database, you must have access to the \fBadmin\fP database. MongoDB
stores the user data and role definitions for all databases in the
\fBadmin\fP database.
.sp
Specifically, to backup a given database\(aqs users, you must have the
\fBfind\fP \fIaction\fP on the \fBadmin\fP
database\(aqs \fBadmin.system.users\fP collection. The \fBbackup\fP
and \fBuserAdminAnyDatabase\fP roles both provide this privilege.
.sp
To backup the user\-defined roles on a database, you must have the
\fBfind\fP action on the \fBadmin\fP database\(aqs
\fBadmin.system.roles\fP collection. Both the \fBbackup\fP and
\fBuserAdminAnyDatabase\fP roles provide this privilege.

.TP
.B \-\-username <username>, \-u
Specifies a username with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the \fB\-\-password\fP and
\fB\-\-authenticationDatabase\fP options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-password <password>, \-p
Specifies a password with which to authenticate to a MongoDB database
that uses authentication. Use in conjunction with the \fB\-\-username\fP and
\fB\-\-authenticationDatabase\fP options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-authenticationDatabase <dbname>
New in version 2.4.

.sp
Specifies the database that holds the user\(aqs credentials.
If you do not specify an authentication database, \fBmongodump\fP assumes
that the database specified as the argument to the \fI\-\-db\fP option
holds the user\(aqs credentials.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-authenticationMechanism <name>
New in version 2.4.

.sp
Specifies the authentication mechanism. By default, the authentication
mechanism is \fBMONGODB\-CR\fP, which is the MongoDB challenge/response
authentication mechanism. In MongoDB Enterprise, \fBmongodump\fP also includes
support for \fBGSSAPI\fP to handle Kerberos authentication. See
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/control\-access\-to\-mongodb\-with\-kerberos\-authentication
for more information about Kerberos authentication.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dbpath <path>
Specifies the directory of the MongoDB data files. If used, the
\fI\-\-dbpath\fP option enables \fBmongodump\fP to attach directly to local data
files without a running \fBmongod\fP\&. When run with \fI\-\-dbpath\fP,
\fBmongodump\fP locks access to the data directory. No \fBmongod\fP can
access the same path while the process runs.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-directoryperdb
When used in conjunction with the corresponding option in
\fBmongod\fP, allows \fBmongodump\fP to access data from MongoDB
instances that use an on\-disk format where every database has a distinct
directory. This option is only relevant when specifying the
\fI\-\-dbpath\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-journal
Allows \fBmongodump\fP operations to use the durability \fIjournal\fP to
ensure data files remain valid and recoverable. This option is only
relevant when specifying the \fI\-\-dbpath\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-db <database>, \-d
Specifies a database to backup. If you do not specify a database,
\fBmongodump\fP copies all databases in this instance into the dump
files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-collection <collection>, \-c
Specifies a collection to backup. If you do not specify a collection,
this option copies all collections in the specified database or instance
to the dump files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-out <path>, \-o
Specifies the directory where \fBmongodump\fP saves the output of
the database dump. By default, \fBmongodump\fP saves output files
in a directory named \fBdump\fP in the current working directory.
.sp
To send the database dump to standard output, specify "\fB\-\fP" instead of
a path. Write to standard output if you want process the output before
saving it, such as to use \fBgzip\fP to compress the dump. When writing
standard output, \fBmongodump\fP does not write the metadata that
writes in a \fB<dbname>.metadata.json\fP file when writing to files
directly.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-query <json>, \-q
Provides a \fIJSON document\fP as a query that optionally limits the
documents included in the output of \fBmongodump\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-oplog
Ensures that \fBmongodump\fP creates a dump of
the database that includes a partial \fIoplog\fP containing operations
from the duration of the \fBmongodump\fP operation. This oplog
produces an effective point\-in\-time snapshot of the state of a
\fBmongod\fP instance. To restore to a specific point\-in\-time
backup, use the output created with this option in conjunction with
\fImongorestore \-\-oplogReplay\fP\&.
.sp
Without \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP, if there are write operations during the dump
operation, the dump will not reflect a single moment in time. Changes
made to the database during the update process can affect the output of
the backup.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP has no effect when running \fBmongodump\fP
against a \fBmongos\fP instance to dump the entire contents of a
sharded cluster. However, you can use \fI\%\-\-oplog\fP to dump
individual shards.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP only works against nodes that maintain an
\fIoplog\fP\&. This includes all members of a replica set, as well as
\fImaster\fP nodes in master/slave replication deployments.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-oplog\fP does not dump the oplog collection.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-repair
Runs a repair option in addition to dumping the
database. The repair option attempts to repair a database that may be in
an invalid state as a result of an improper shutdown or
\fBmongod\fP crash.
.sp
The \fI\%\-\-repair\fP option uses aggressive data\-recovery algorithms
that may produce a large amount of duplication.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-forceTableScan
Forces \fBmongodump\fP to scan the data store directly: typically,
\fBmongodump\fP saves entries as they appear in the index of the
\fB_id\fP field. Use \fI\-\-forceTableScan\fP to skip the index and scan
the data directly. Typically there are two cases where this behavior is
preferable to the default:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP 1. 3
If you have key sizes over 800 bytes that would not be present in the
\fB_id\fP index.
.IP 2. 3
Your database uses a custom \fB_id\fP field.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When you run with \fI\-\-forceTableScan\fP, \fBmongodump\fP does
not use \fB$snapshot\fP\&. As a result, the dump produced by
\fBmongodump\fP can reflect the state of the database at many
different points in time.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Use \fI\-\-forceTableScan\fP with extreme caution and
consideration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dumpDbUsersAndRoles
Includes user and role definitions when performing \fBmongodump\fP
on a specific database. This option applies only when you specify a
database in the \fI\-\-db\fP option. MongoDB always includes user and
role definitions when \fBmongodump\fP applies to an entire instance
and not just a specific database.
.UNINDENT
.SH USE
.sp
See the http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/backup\-with\-mongodump
for a larger overview of \fBmongodump\fP usage. Also see the
\fBmongorestore\fP document for an overview of the
\fBmongorestore\fP, which provides the related inverse
functionality.
.sp
The following command creates a dump file that contains only the
collection named \fBcollection\fP in the database named \fBtest\fP\&. In
this case the database is running on the local interface on port
\fB27017\fP:

In the next example, \fBmongodump\fP creates a backup of the
database instance stored in the \fB/srv/mongodb\fP directory on the
local machine. This requires that no \fBmongod\fP instance is
using the \fB/srv/mongodb\fP directory.

In the final example, \fBmongodump\fP creates a database dump
located at \fB/opt/backup/mongodump\-2011\-10\-24\fP, from a database
running on port \fB37017\fP on the host \fBmongodb1.example.net\fP and
authenticating using the username \fBuser\fP and the password
\fBpass\fP, as follows:
